### Gradle Configuration ###
# Sets JVM arguments for Gradle to improve performance and stability.

### Loom Configuration ###
# Allows us to use dependencies built with newer Loom by ignoring that it was built against a differing Loom version.
# This is absolutely necessary because we use an older fork of Loom to enable Legacy Forge support.
# As far as can be seen, there are absolutely no negative side effects to doing this. If you encounter any,
# feel free to report them to the template's issue tracker and comment this line out to see if it resolves them.
# You won't be able to use any dependencies built by newer Loom without this line, however.
loom.ignoreDependencyLoomVersionValidation=true
